# PromoPal
The "PromoPal" Android app, developed using Android Studio, is a self-promotion application designed to simplify the process of sending promotional messages via SMS and email.
The app starts with a captivating splash screen that provides a concise description of its purpose and functionalities.
On the home screen, users are presented with two distinct cards labeled "SMS" and "Email," representing the messaging options.
Selecting either card directs users to the corresponding page where they input recipient details and create compelling promotional messages. 
The SMS page prompts users to enter the mobile number and other relevant information, while the Email page requires email address and message details.
Both pages offer customization options like selecting names, specifying positions, and immediate start. After completing the forms, users can preview the auto-generated messages for accuracy.
They then have the flexibility to choose between sending the message via SMS or email based on their desired communication channel. The PromoPal app streamlines self-promotion by providing customizable templates, easy input forms, and message previews, enhancing the user's promotional messaging experience.
